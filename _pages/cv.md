My CV can be obtained from [here](https://amirsojoodi.github.io/files/AmirHosseinSojoodi-Resume-Summary.pdf), and its fully extended version is available [there](https://amirsojoodi.github.io/files/AmirHosseinSojoodi-Resume-Extended.pdf). (I don't believe you may need the extended version. That's just for myself to keep track of my life, and whoever that is interested.)
